Learning Lua
============

This repository contains notes used for supporting the Commotion Wireless team in learning Lua to work with the Commotion user interfaces. It is built upon notes David Osiro created for his series of instructional videos on learning Lua. The video lessons can be found on David Oshiro's [youtube channel](http://www.youtube.com/user/davidoshiro).
