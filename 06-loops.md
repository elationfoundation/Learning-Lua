Loops
=====

Loops are another necessary type of statement in programming. Loops execute blocks of code for a predefined or undefined number of times. There are three types of loops in Lua:

* `for`
* `while`
* `repeat`

For example, let's print `Hello World` 10 times:

    for i=1, 10 do
      print('Hello World')
    end
    
    x = 1
    while x <= 10 do
      print('Hello World')
      x = x + 1
    end
    
    y = 1
    repeat
      print('Hello World')
      y = y + 1
    until y > 10

All of the above examples will output `Hello World` 10 times. Why are there different types of loops? As far as I can tell it has to do with what are trying to do. If you know that you want to do something for a specific number of times, you may prefer to use a for loop because the counting is done for you. If you want to evaluate a condition at the beginning of each block of code, then you would use the `while` loop. If you want to evaluate a condition at the end of a block then you would use the `repeat` loop.

Iterating Through Arrays
------------------------

Sometimes you will know how many items you have in your array and sometimes you will not. Lua makes it easy to iterate through arrays using the `for` loop.

If you have an array of 5 fruits, it is simple to print out each fruit.

    fruit = {"apple", "banana", "pear", "grape", "lemon"}
    for i=1, 5 do 
      print(fruit[i])
    end
    => apple
       banana
       pear
       grape
       lemon

Let's say you do not know the contents of your array, it is still simple to print out each item. 

    for _,v in ipairs(fruit) do
      print(v)
    end
    => apple
       banana
       pear
       grape
       lemon

The example above shows the use of the `ipairs` function. This function allows you to iterate through all the items in an indexed array. the `_` and `v` variables contain the current array index and it's associated value. This is simple enough since the indexes start at 1 and gets incremented up to whatever `#fruit` may be. The `_` is commonly used to signify to other Lua coders that the index is unused.

But what about key/value tables? Remember that tables may use indexes and/or keys to reference values. Lua makes iterating through these tables simple as well.

    fruits = {apples="red", banana="yellow", orange="orange", grape="purple"}
    for k in pairs(fruits) do
      print(k .. " is " .. fruits[k])
    end
    => grape is purple
       orange is orange
       apples is red
       banana is yellow

You can also just call pairs with two values in the same way you used ipairs.
	   
    fruits = {apples="red", banana="yellow", orange="orange", grape="purple"}
    for i,k in pairs(fruits) do
      print(i .. " is " .. k)
    end
    => grape is purple
       banana is yellow
       apples is red
       orange is orange
	   
The examplea above shows the use of the `pairs` function. While `ipairs` is used for indexed arrays, `pairs` is used for key/value tables as well as indexed arrays. You'll notice that the order of the output is not how we initialized the `fruits` table. This is because the table is not indexed and therefore has no order. Ordering our list is easy enough, though.

    fruits = {{apples="red"}, {banana="yellow"}, {orange="orange"}, {grape="purple"}}
    for i,v in ipairs(fruits) do
      for k in pairs(v) do
        print(k .. " is " .. v[k])
      end
    end
    => apples is red
       banana is yellow
       orange is orange
       grape is purple

The example above shows that I created an index array of 4 items. Each item is a key/value table. This is sort of like a database where each indexed item is a row of data. Each row contains a fruit and its color. If we step through the `for` loops we will get the following:

* i=1 and v={apples="red"}
* k="apples" and v[k]="red"
* i=2 and v={banana="yellow"}
* k="banana" and v[k]="yellow"
etc...
